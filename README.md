Portfolio project for Into to Programming course with Code the Dream

Please check my Portfolio that was made along the Intro to Programming course.  The project was incorporating new elements each week, since styling, formatting to Asynchronous Programming and Promises.

Please get to know me and leave a message so I can keep your information to stay in contact.

Also, through my Portfolio you can acces My Open API Project where I create a "Weather Finder App".
